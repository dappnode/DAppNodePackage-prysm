    title: Add a backup web3 provider
    description: >-
      It's a good idea to add a backup web3 provider in case your main one goes down. For example, if your primary EL client is a local Geth, but you want to use Infura as a backup.
      Get your web3 backup from [infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Prysm up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Prysm from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Prysm docs](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/parameters/)
      Use the dappnode official endpoint **https://checkpoint-sync.dappnode.io/** or get your checkpoint sync from [infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon-mainnet.infura.io)

      Fee Recipient is a feature that lets you specify a priority fee recipient address on your validator client instance and beacon node. After The Merge, execution clients will begin depositing priority fees into this address whenever your validator client proposes a new block.
