    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Prysm up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Prysm from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check the [Prysm docs](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/checkpoint-sync) for more information.
      Use the Dappnode Official endpoint `https://checkpoint-sync.dappnode.io` or get your checkpoint sync from [Infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon.infura.io)
      *Note - If you are going to provide your own checkpoint sync endpoint, make sure you do not use a slash `/` at the end of the URL.*

      Fee Recipient is a feature that lets you specify a priority fee recipient address on your validator client instance and beacon node. Make sure this is an address you control. After The Merge, Execution Clients will begin depositing priority fees into this address whenever your validator proposes a new block.
