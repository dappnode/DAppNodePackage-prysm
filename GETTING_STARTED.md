## Welcome to the Merge Ready Consensus Client: Prysm

- Your keystores should now managed in the [web3signer-ui](http://ui.web3signer.dappnode?signer_url=http://web3signer.web3signer.dappnode:9000) 
- Don't have the web3signer installed yet? You may not have migrated to the mainnet-multiclient, which is necessary for the Merge. It can be manually installed [here](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/web3signer.web3signer.dnp.dappnode.eth)
- With this update the Execution Layer Client must be selected in the Consensus Client, and the chosen Consensus Client is selected in the [Web3Signer](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/web3signer.dnp.dappnode.eth/config).
